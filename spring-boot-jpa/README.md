This is a Spring Boot RESTful service for searching and managing Events (happenings at a certain time and place).

It uses JPA and Hibernate Spatial to persist and retrieve Events.

To get started, clone the repo or download the source and run
```
$ mvn  spring-boot:run
```

Note
====

This is very much a work-in-progress, so check back regularly and see it grow.
